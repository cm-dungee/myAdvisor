				<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
				<button type="button" class="collapsible">What happens if my GPA drops below a 2.0?</button>
				<div class="coll-content">
					<h3>Students enrolled in courses at the college are expected to make positive academic progress. Positive progress includes any of the 
					following:</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Passing any transitional (ESL, developmental English, reading, or math) courses with a Pass (P) or High Pass (HP)</li>
						<li>Passing a college-level graded course with a C or higher.</li>
					</ul>
					<p style="color:red;"><em><strong>Note: Although a D-grade (1.0) is considered a passing grade according to Financial Aid and the College, it 
					does not help students increase their GPA so a C-grade (2.0) is recommended. The minimum overall GPA requirement to stay in good academic 
					standing is a 2.0. If your GPA drops below a 2.0 you will be put placed on Academic Probation.</strong></em></p>
					<h3>Probation</h3>
					<p>A student will be placed on <em>Academic Probation</em> if he/she/they have completed six (6) or more graded credits and whose cumulative grade 
					point average is less than a 2.0 (“C”) during the next session in attendance. A separate process known as a <em>Lack of Progress</em> hold, will be placed 
					on a student’s registration if the student has not met the 
					Satisfactory Progress guidelines in the Student Handbook, even if that student is technically in “good academic standing” with a 2.0 GPA or above.
					<br>
					The same three (3) step process follows with both the Academic Probation and Lack of Progress status hold:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>A college letter is sent to the student, as well as an email letter to the student’s delaGATE account, recommending that the student 
						meet with his/her/their advisor prior to the end of the term to discuss the student’s difficulties.</li>
						<li>A registration hold is placed on the student’s account.</li>
						<li>Ignoring this status and recommendations may result in a student being academically dismissed from the college for the following 
						semester.</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				
				<button type="button" class="collapsible">What is Academic Suspension?!</button>
				<div class="coll-content">
					<h3>If a student’s academic progress continues to decline during their academic probation term, the student will face Academic 
					Suspension.</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>An email and mailed letter are sent notifying the student they are academically suspended for the following semester (Fall or Spring)
						.</li>
						<li>Students can appeal for reasons that meet the same criteria as <a href="https://delagate.dccc.edu/students/student-accounts/withdrawal-refund-info" target="_blank">Medical, Significant Life Event, or Military Withdraws</a> and within 30 
						days of the end of the Spring semester.</li>
					</ul>

				<button type="button" class="collapsible">How Do I Apply for Graduation?</button>
				<div class="coll-content">

					diploma.</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>The form can be found <a href="https://delagate.dccc.edu/students/registration-records/apply-graduate" target="_blank">here.</a> (requires delaGATE 
						login)</li>

				<button type="button" class="collapsible">I have a hold on my account! Why can't I register myself for classes?</button>
				<div class="coll-content">
					<h3>Self-registration is possible but you will be prevented from doing so if you meet any of the following criteria:</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>you are in the process of or still need to successfully pass ENG 050, REA 030 or 050, or ESL courses.</li>
						<li>your overall GPA has fallen below a 2.0.</li>
						<li>you have not been making satisfactory academic progress.</li>
